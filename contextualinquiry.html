PROJECT OVERVIEW
Through the School of Information course "SI 501: Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations, I worked as part of a team with a student engagement initiative, which I will call “The Initiative” for confidentially purposes, on the University of Michigan's campus. The Initiative needed a new system for displaying student works through online portfolios to the public because the partnership with the company in charge of their current system is ending soon.

In this project, our team adopted a human-centered information gathering and analysis approach, contextual inquiry, to tackle the problem. With this method, the whole process from problem to solution experienced three stages: we started from problem identification and literature reviews to understand backgrounds and contexts of the problem, after which we targeted user groups, took interviews, and debriefed notes as a basis for next stage analysis. In the end, we evaluated the data we had gathered and created an affinity wall to identify critical patterns and develop insights. We used these insights as the basis for our final recommendations. Details of each stage are reflected below.

QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS
With the notes we collected, our team started to analyze the information using an affinity wall method, which we thought was the most effective way to organize the raw data for qualitative insights. First, we clustered notes that reflected a similar theme, then built hierarchy summarization upon each cluster. This led us to the final major findings concerning the urgent need to fix searching functions of the current system as well as the conflicts between individual user’s needs and the standardization requirement.  With these findings in mind, our team brainstormed possible solutions together and reached final recommendations.

FINDINGS
After analyzing our interview notes using the affinity wall, we identified three main use cases for the online portfolio platform: school accreditation, aggregating and grading assignments, and internship research. We then evaluated how well Seelio was meeting these needs.


CONCLUSION
Our team investigated the problem that the OPCE faces regarding the need to display student works to the public. Our plan of action was to interview users of the current product (faculty, staff, and students) to better understand its uses and limitations. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interviews, the interpretation sessions of those interviews and affinity wall analysis, we found three primary use cases for the current online portfolio platform: use in the UMSI school accreditation process, the aggregation and grading of course-related assignments, and internship research.
After analyzing the data, we recommend that OPCE use a combination of an online portfolio system and a tool that aggregates internship information, such as a master spreadsheet. A new online portfolio system can maintain the requirements of renewing accreditation and grading assignments. Meanwhile, the spreadsheet can help students research internships quickly and efficiently without worrying about poor searching functionality.
