Problem Statement
African Americans are 20% more likely to suffer from mental health issues compared to the general population, but there is a severe lack of mental health awareness in black communities. Individuals that may need help do not receive it for various reasons.
- Stigma associated with mental illness
- Lack of providers from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds
- Cost (Therapy is not cheap)

Target Audience
Black college students (undergrad, graduate or doctoral students) at the University of Michigan
- Easily accessible
- High probability that they have a smartphone with a data plan
- Most likely comfortable using mobile applications

My Solution
My solution is to develop a mobile application that will provide users with mental health assessments, information regarding the types of mental illness/disorders and their symptoms, tips on how to cope, and phone numbers of relevant resources like CAPS. The goal of the application is to help spread mental health awareness in the black community and hopefully give individuals resources to seek help if needed.
I want to challenge the societal norm of mental health not being a topic of discussion in the black community. My original target audience was black communities in Detroit, Michigan, but early in the project, I decided that the scope was too broad for this course and posed several limitations (i.e., accessibility to users, implementation issues). I rethought my approach and shifted to students for the reasons specified in my problem statement.
My hope is that students will use the information within the app to start a dialogue on the topic. Eventually, I would like to take what i’ve learned from this project and revisit a way to spread mental health awareness amongst communities in Detroit, Michigan.
Note: Users receive a disclaimer that says information on the app is not an official diagnosis

Design Philosophy
My philosophy was that the content should speak for itself and be the main focal point of the design, therefore, I chose to keep the layout plain. I wanted to incorporate affordances that users were familiar with using other applications (i.e., a menu icon, previous button icons and a minimalist layout).

Design Flow
Important note: The digital prototype is modeled for an Android phone. The first screen a user sees after opening the application is the disclaimer screen. Users can either click “decline” (takes them out of the app) or “accept”. If “accept” is selected, the user goes to the log-in page with choices to sign into their account or create a new one. If the user needs to create an account, they are redirected to an account creation screen where they can enter and confirm an email address, as well as, create a password.


Design Rationale for Target Audience
The original audience was Black communities in Detroit, Michigan
The scope was too large for this class and needed to be scaled down
I switched to Black college students at UM because:
Personal experience
Speaking with other students and hearing their stories about CAPS


What's Next? 
- Flesh out the information section of the application with real articles
- Search for more mental health related alternatives to CAPS
- Work towards a fully functional prototype
- Conduct interviews with real students and do usability testing
