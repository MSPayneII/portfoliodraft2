Project Objective:
To determine how easily navigable the Ross School of Business Website is compared to other business school websites (Columbia Business School and Stanford Graduate School of Business).

Research Questions:
- How confused are respondents when trying to find the Behavioral Lab page on each website?
- On average, how many points do participants fixate on when navigating to the Behavioral Lab page?


Project Summary:
- Within-subjects study design
      Calibration -> Baseline -> Pre-Survey -> Website 1 -> Survey 1 -> Website 2 -> Survey 2 -> Website 3 -> -Survey 3 -> Final Survey
- Number of Respondents: 7 (all female participants)
- Stimuli used:
      3 Business school websites: Columbia, Ross and Stanford.
- Conducted in the Ross School of Business Behavioral Lab using eye tracker and facial expressions
- Measures: Visual attention, final number of fixation sequence, brow furrow, heatmaps, AOI markers and self report


What is eye tracking?
Eye tracking is the process of capturing data about the position of the eye relative to 2D or 3D space

What does eye tracking tell us?
Eye tracking gives us important information about visual processing and attention

We leveraged eye tracking data to identify the pattern of visual attention on menu options while navigating through each website. For this we focused on the fixation sequence for each participant. This allowed us to get the average fixation numbers for each website.
For the flyer advertisements, we used AOI markers and heat maps to determine what aspects of the flyers attract visual engagement the fastest and what holds their attention the longest.


What are facial expressions?
Facial expressions are movements of the numerous muscles supplied by the facial nerve that are attached to and move the facial skin.

Affectiva Affdex (the facial expressions engine we use in this study) monitors small muscular movements of specific areas of the face (also called action units) and calculates underlying facial expressions. It also calculates other attributes such as engagement – or sustained attention to the stimuli.

We leveraged facial expression data to identity confusion using brow furrow during website navigation.


Key findings:
- We determined that the Ross School of Business website was less easily navigable than the Columbia and Stanford websites.
- On average, participants had more fixation points when navigating through the Ross website compared to the other websites.
- On average, participants had higher average brow furrow when navigating through the Ross website compared to the other websites.
- Both of the biometric predictors were strong in this study.
- The facial expression data seemed to correlate with the survey data.
- The eye-tracking data helped us to determine how long

Recommendations:
- The Ross School of Business may want to devote more time to making their website more user friendly.

Visual Attention for websites
Conclusions:
On average, participants had the most fixation points on the Ross website.
Participants had the least fixation points when navigating through the Stanford website.

Facial Expression Analysis
Conclusion: On average, participants furrowed their brow more when navigating through the Ross website than they did when viewing the other websites. One participant did have much higher brow furrow for all three website compared to the other participants, but even when this participant’s data is taken out, there is still a difference between the websites. This shows that on average, participants were more confused when viewing the Ross website than they were when viewing the other websites.

Survey Results
Conclusions: The survey results indicate that participants found the Columbia and Ross website were the most difficult to navigate through. In contrast, we can see that the Stanford website was consistently rated as being easier to navigate through. In addition, we can see that Stanford had the highest number of ratings of “not confused at all”. Ross had the highest number of moderately confused participants.

Study Limitations and Adjustments
Limitations
- Small sample size
- Navigation cueing with websites
- Not taking screen brightness into account
- Lab lighting
- Scheduling conflicts

Adjustments
- More participants
- Website cueing is unavoidable but not bad due to websites adopting different terminology
- Use a spotlight that will shine light behind the participant and not directly on them


Takeaways
The use of biometrics in research adds another layer of data collection that cannot be captured when using only computer surveys. With surveys, participants may not provide genuine answers for a number of reasons. Biometrics gives researchers the ability to record subconscious, split second reactions to stimuli that can go unreported in self reports.
